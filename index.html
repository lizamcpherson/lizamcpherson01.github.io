  VISTA HERMOSA, Colombia — White Brahman cattle munched grass under a mango tree as Bernardo Velasco stretched out his right hand, pointing to a section of green pasture on his farm.

“This all used to be coca,” he said, referring to the plant used to make cocaine, which he and other farmers here once grew in abundance.

Today Mr. Velasco, 50, and most of his neighbors have traded in their coca for other crops, growing cacao (for making chocolate), corn and plantains in an ambitious plan to stabilize parts of Colombia long controlled by rebel fighters, paramilitary groups and drug traffickers.

The effort has suddenly gained new urgency, given the government’s decision last month to halt a longstanding American-backed campaign to kill coca crops with aerial spraying. Now, Colombia will have to rely more heavily on approaches like this one.

But despite early advances, the effort here has fallen far short of expectations, raising questions about whether the government can transform other troubled parts of the country.

“We’re going on eight years since they eradicated coca here, eight years,” said Gilberto Olaya, 54, a dairy farmer and a member of the municipal council here in Vista Hermosa. “And you don’t see clear policies where the government says, ‘O.K., we’re going to come to you with the things you need to get by, to earn a decent wage that you can survive on, like you could with coca.’”

The farmers here are the earliest beneficiaries of a showcase project financed with hundreds of millions of dollars in American aid.

The goal was to use the Colombian Army and the police to drive out the guerrillas, destroy coca and then bring in the civilian authorities to help local farmers grow legal crops in a place where the government had no more than a token presence for decades.

But years after the program started, many residents say that they are still waiting for electricity and paved roads, and that rebel fighters still lord over them, frustrating the farmers and others whose confidence it was meant to win over.

“We need much more commitment, more decisiveness from the government,” Mr. Olaya said. “Things have stagnated.”

The success, or failure, of such efforts are especially important given the government’s negotiations with the country’s largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.

If the talks lead to a peace agreement, the government’s ambitious goal of integrating former guerrilla strongholds into the national fabric will depend greatly on the experiences here.

Heightening concerns, a large stream of American aid backing the program is coming to an end, at the same time that the Colombian government’s funding for the effort has declined.

Begun in 2007, the consolidation program, as the effort is known, focused on a rural area in central Colombia known as La Macarena. It includes this farming town, where the Colombian plains meet the foothills of the Andes.

Started by President Juan Manuel Santos when he served as defense minister under his predecessor, Álvaro Uribe, the project made immediate strides.

The FARC was pushed back, government teams ripped up vast plantings of coca, and farmers planted cacao and other substitute crops. The region became a showcase. American congressmen, business executives, diplomats, foreign correspondents and many others were brought in to get a glimpse of the future of Colombia.

The project set out to bring rural residents under the governmental umbrella for the first time and create the conditions for them to succeed. That meant improving roads needed to bring crops to market, giving titles to farmland, granting agricultural loans, bringing electricity to isolated hamlets, and setting up government services like courts, schools and health clinics.

But critics say that after Mr. Santos was elected president in 2010, the government’s interest seemed to wane.

Álvaro Balcázar, the original director of the program, who left in 2012, said that it suffered from the start from bureaucratic inertia and that other government agencies were slow to get involved. After some initial success in La Macarena, the program was expanded to include other areas of the country, but he said it ultimately lost focus.

“The promise was that the government was going to establish a presence in the regions, and that promise has not been met,” Mr. Balcázar said.

The area around Vista Hermosa shows notable achievements and stunning shortfalls.

This was once one of the country’s most productive coca-growing areas. It was also part of a zone that was ceded to the FARC, which uses drug trafficking to finance its activities, during an earlier round of peace negotiations from 1999 to 2002.

Today, fields once bright with the pale green of coca plants are now filled with the dark green of cacao bushes planted with American assistance.

A paved road connects Vista Hermosa to nearby cities. There is a government health clinic and a branch of the government-run agricultural bank. With the help of a privately owned dairy company and American financing, dairy farmers now send their milk to collection centers where it is stored in refrigerated tanks. As a result, dairy production has soared.

But much remains to be done. Among the government’s top priorities was giving farmers title to their land. Having a title is vital because it allows farmers to use land as collateral for loans.

But it took until last month, after years of waiting, for the first 16 farm families to receive titles to their land. Officials said they hoped that a few dozen more could get titles by the end of the year.
