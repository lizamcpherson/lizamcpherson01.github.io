## Overview

#### Motivation

- I want to create a blog that's basically like having a tumblr but not weird. so i can post photos, text posts etc, and tag each of them so users can see just my photos or gopro videos, for instance.
- the target audience is my friends and family, and i think it would be cool if i could use it as a kind of journal/thought space/post quotes and pics that inspire me & travel blog to chronicle my adventures
- this is just for fun and to practice my skills

#### Content

- What do I want to actually put on it? Suggestions:
- Links to things you've made (photos, videos, class projects)
- Yet another blog
- A self intro, with links to how to contact you (FB, Github, etc.)
- Be as specific as you can here

## Design

- minimalist and clean, but not like modern and cold
- Will you use images? Icons? From where?
- i want to have a header at the top with an avatar (photo saved on my computer, figure out how to make this work if it's a live website - imgur?) and a navigation menu with links. the home page will default to a college of all of my posts, and searching for tagged posts will be by clicking the links at the top. there will be an about me link on the top left. when you hover over about me you will see a drop down menu for my favorite movies, music, books, etc.
